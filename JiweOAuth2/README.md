# Wallet API Documentation

The Jiwe Wallet API is designed to allow you to authenticate players and allow them to receive rewards and make purchases on their accounts.

As the developer, the game will be drawing and crediting your account for any in-game transaction by players. You can keep track of transactions through the Jiwe IO wallet dashboard for your records and to make sure you have a positive wallet balance to maintain normal functionality.

**2)Adding authentication to your game:**

**How authentication works:**

****Steps:**

1. Generating game wallet ID API key (Each game requires a unique wallet ID)
2. Downloading and importing the JiweOAuth2 SDK and integrating the game wallet ID

1. **Generating the game wallet ID**

1. Go to your profile settings by selecting the profile button on the left panel on Jiwe IO
2. Select Apps from the top tabs, follow the instructions and generate a unique Game Wallet ID, API Key and API Secret for each game you create  

   (For security purposes a unique key is required for each game to be able to validate or invalidate each game individually.)

**B. Download and import the JiweWallet SDK to your game**

**Download the JiweWallet SDK for Unity from here (Github)**

The JiweWallet SDK for Unity allows you to authenticate players on start by redirecting to a web browser page that allows you to log in with their Jiwe IO credentials and receive a token back that will be passed to the game to give the user access to the game. Using this token the player will be able to recieve and make purchases later.

**_\*If_**_after followingthe steps below and importing the first _**_JiweOAuth2 script_**_and you receive the following_**_error:”newtonsoft namespace is missing”_**_, go to the root SDK folder and drag and drop the "Newtonsoft.Json.dll" file into your assets folder (or download it from_[_www.nuget.org_](http://www.nuget.org)_search for the newtonsoft.json file)_

- Open your game build in your editor

- Download JiweWallet SDK for Unity from here (Github)

- Unzip it into a folder

- Switch to your game in the Unity engine and create thr “JiweWallet” folder in your scripts folder, then import the JiweOAuth2 and Reward scripts into your JiweWallet folder

- In your Hierarchy module on the top right, create an empty game object and name it JiweSDK and select it

- After selecting it go to your inspector and select add component and add the JiweOAuth2 Script from the scripts folder

- Put the JiweOAuth2 script in a scene game object and configure the settings below using the inspector

  - And update the configuration details on the inspector with the appropriate links

    - _Client ID (Generated in your Jiwe profile page)_
    - _API Key (Generated in your Jiwe profile page)_
    - _App Secret (Generated in your Jiwe profile page)_
    - _GameID(Your game name)_
    - _<https://id.jiwe.io/auth>_
    - _<https://id.jiwe.io/token>_
    - _<https://id.jiwe.io/me>_

1. Test the functionality by running the game build, which should open a popup web browser first thing the game starts and allow you to login via your Jiwe IO credentials, and then redirect you back to the game.
2. IF the login is successful the game will start and if the login fails you will not get the access token and will get an error message on your browser.
3. The SDK is configured such that if you do not get a token the game will not start.

**3. Adding purchase and reward functionality through the JiweWallet SDK**

**3a. How the reward and purchase functionality works:**

Integrating the rewards and purchase functionality which can be called anywhere in the game by integrating the functions below, please make sure you have the correct game wallet id and enough budget for each future transaction.

**a) The rewards and purchase functionality:**

- After downloading and importing the jiweOAuth2 and rewards scripts into your script folder

You can call the reward or purchase functionality whenever you want to reward or charge the player for an achievement or a loss within the game.

The rewards function is called by using the following method within the game:

_reward.RewardPlayer( 0.1, "ORDER_ID", "Reward for passing boss#1");_

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_wKPE6vQFGV9kkgGOHOAh-qOipbsQd6UWgt1YMJ5Da4Zf9Y7XvbOzaBGwyBVrUJqMQROGWNkaneiH68pmlHhI73Wk2HbixOpfgQv3_gDTAaGfb1w41REY-RM_PNY0udoYc0SWLPScPKqHetiI6DKFKXDGukVIP2qSoR0VHLvCnyUnfXkmyTCPcvQxg)

Variables being passed:

- 0.1 - is the amount to be rewarded
- Order_ID - is useful for the dev’s records to know which reward he has given
- “Reward for passing boss#1” - is a description of the reward

The method can be called at any time as long as it has a trigger. 

You have to switch to scripts (using your favorite script editor) to include the method to call the reward function.

The reward acts as a debit to the developer's wallet and a credit to the player's wallet. 

If the game wallet is at 0 the response will be an error 429: Bad request on the console log. (Please use the console log on the Unity engine to view and log errors)

If this error occurs the developer can display it on screen for the player.


**Adding Purchases:**

Similar to the rewards function, you can call the purchase functionality whenever you want the gamer to pay or purchase something from the game.

The purchase function is called by using the following method within the game:

_reward.purchase( 0.1, "ORDER_ID", "Purchasing pigs in a blanket");_

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_wKPE6vQFGV9kkgGOHOAh-qOipbsQd6UWgt1YMJ5Da4Zf9Y7XvbOzaBGwyBVrUJqMQROGWNkaneiH68pmlHhI73Wk2HbixOpfgQv3_gDTAaGfb1w41REY-RM_PNY0udoYc0SWLPScPKqHetiI6DKFKXDGukVIP2qSoR0VHLvCnyUnfXkmyTCPcvQxg)

Variables being passed:

- 0.1 - is the amount to be charged
- Order_ID - is useful for the dev’s records to know which reward he has given
- “Purchasing pigs in a blanket" - is a description of the purchase

The method can be called at any time as long as it has a trigger. 

You have to switch to scripts (using your favorite script editor) to include the method to call the purchase function.

The purchase acts as debit to the player's wallet and a credit to the developers's wallet. 

If the player's wallet is at 0 the response will be a error 429: Bad request. Which the developer can log and display on screen for the player.
